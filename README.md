### ** INTRODUCTION **

### Implement Single Page Real Estate “Rent a Property” web app with filtering mechanism.

I have 4 levels of filtering as shown in the reference link - web app should display results which satisfies all the filters.
Used dummy data - make sure to have enough dummy data to display results after applying filters
Implement in React.
Used any third party CSS library such as Material UI, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, etc.


### You will be judged on the following criteria

1. Page Layout and Functionality
2. Code Readability and Structure
3. Parent-Child component communication
4. Information hierarchy of all the content and
 components
